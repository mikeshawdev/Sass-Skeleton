Sass-Skeleton
=============

A base set of Sass files that can be used as the foundation for any project. These are kept deliberately simple, with as few opinionated settings as possible (although I can't promise there won't be a few!).

I have tried my best to include code credit in the files where necessary. I apologise if I missed a few.
